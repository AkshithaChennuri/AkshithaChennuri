    <p>Flipkart Inc. is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home bravia bedsheets essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.[5][6] In 2025, the company shifted domicile from Singapore to India.[7]

    The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[8][9] As of FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[10] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.</p>

    <p>Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore[12] by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT Delhi and former Amazon employees.[13][14][15] The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Koramangala, Bengaluru. The initial investment was provided by their families, which was INR 2 Lakh from each family. The website was kicked off in October 2007 and the company was only limited to selling books at that time country-wide shipping.[16] Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[17] Flipkart acquired WeRead in 2010 from Lulu.com that helped it build its foundational strength which was the digital retail of books. </p>

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[20] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[21] Following the acquisition, Flipkart launched its DRM-free Digital music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[22][23][24][25] Mime360 was a content distributor that used HTTP-based encryption technology that allows for fast and secure data delivery. It distributed music, media and games using its distribution platform.[26]

    With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[27] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[28] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[29]</p>
